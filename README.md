# Hacking with Swift

This is the source code to accompany Hacking with Swift, [a free tutorial series that teaches Swift coding for iOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com). There is one folder for the classic Hacking with Swift course, which teaches UIKit and SpriteKit, and another folder for the SwiftUI edition.

All projects should be compatible with Xcode 11 and iOS 13. Where appropriate, separate project files have been provided so that you can follow the tutorial from scratch without having to dig around in the completed project folder.

If you have questions, you can find me on Twitter [@twostraws](https://www.twitter.com/twostraws).

Swift Coding Challenges is an all-new book written from the ground up to put your Swift skills to the test. I've written a variety of coding challenges that start off simple but slowly get harder, and it's down to you to solve them. I outline each problem, provide you with sample input and output, add in some hints in case you hit problems, then provide a sample solution and explain how it works.
